This organisation follows the [OpenSSF Vulnerability Disclosure guide](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/tree/main).

Please report vulnerabilities via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). Each repository has its own security advisories page.

## AI Policy

See the [Security & Vulnerability Reports section of the AI Policy](AI_POLICY.md#security--vulnerability-reports) before using AI tools to find or report vulnerabilities.

## Response Time

This is a solo-maintained project. I aim to respond within 7 days of your report. If confirmed as a vulnerability, I will open a Security Advisory and follow a 90-day disclosure timeline.
